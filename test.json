This partnership streamlines network-aware app creation, particularly for low-latency scenarios and validates Telef\u00f3nica's improved connectivity and lower latency that aligns with GSMA's Open Gateway initiative for network API interoperability.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>MEC-as-a-service is continuously evolving to add new concepts related to distributed DB-as-a-service (DBaaS), 3GPP SA6 Frameworks, session continuity for mobility, edge-to-cloud continuum.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The EDGEAPP architecture developed by 3GPP SA6 facilitates smooth communication between applications on user devices and dedicated servers positioned at the network's edge. This architectural approach guarantees the consistent operation of these servers across different network segments, enabling the provision of a wide range of services.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Session and service continuity enables dynamic application relocation and seamless transition and maintenance of user sessions as devices move between different edge nodes or network areas. Whereas edge to cloud continuum involves efficiently managing computing and network resources to ensure a balance between performance, security, and cost effectiveness in edge environments.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>While the industry is currently investigating MEC APIs for various edge applications, other MEC-as-a-Service concepts are still in their early stages, with 3GPP standards being the primary focus at present. As the edge computing landscape develops and expands into critical, real-time, and advanced scenarios, emerging concepts including DBaaS, session continuity, EDGEAPP architecture, and the edge-to-cloud continuum will become more significant.
